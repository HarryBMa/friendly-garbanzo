## Getting Started

### Development

npm run build
```

### Deployment

1. Copy the built `Tavlan.exe` to your network drive
2. Multiple users can run the executable simultaneously from the same network location
3. All schedule changes are automatically synchronized between users

## Network Synchronization

The app uses file-based synchronization to enable multi-user collaboration:

- **Sync File**: `schedule-sync.json` created next to the executable
- **Lock Mechanism**: Prevents data corruption during simultaneous writes
- **Change Detection**: Automatic file watching and periodic polling
- **Conflict Resolution**: UI prompts when simultaneous edits are detected
