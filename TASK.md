## üß™ Prompt Guidelines
- Each time you generate code with AI or Copilot:
  - Log the date
  - Summarize the task/prompt
  - Log the result or new files created/edited
- Keep AI tasks specific and modular (1 file or behavior at a time)
- Avoid multi-purpose prompts ‚Äî split UI and logic tasks separately

## üöß Current Tasks

### [2025-06-03] Single File Upload Fix
**Prompt**: Fix single file upload functionality that doesn't work with OP/ANE format files
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Updated single file import to support structured parsing

**Root Cause**: The `importStaffFromExcel` function was only handling simple 3-column Excel format (Name, Work hours, Comments), but the actual OP and ANE files use a complex schedule format that requires structured parsing.

**Resolution**: 
- ‚úÖ Updated `importStaffFromExcel` function to try structured parsing first (using `readExcelFile` helper)
- ‚úÖ Added fallback to simple format parsing for backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging to show which parsing method was successful
- ‚úÖ Maintains compatibility with both formats: structured OP/ANE files and simple 3-column files

**Result**: Single file upload now works with both OP and ANE files individually, using the same structured parsing logic as the dual import feature.

### [2025-06-03] Excel Import Production Debugging
**Prompt**: Debug Excel import functionality showing "failed error" in live application despite passing unit tests
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Root cause identified and fixed

**Root Cause**: Main process was using wrong Excel parser (`readExcelFile`) expecting simple Name/Hours/Comments format, but real files use complex schedule format requiring structured parser.

**Resolution**: 
- ‚úÖ Updated `readExcelFile` function in `fileHandler.ts` to use structured parsing logic based on working `excelParser.ts`
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging throughout import workflow for debugging
- ‚úÖ Fixed Electron API availability issue (`npm run dev` vs `npm run electron:dev`)
- ‚úÖ Successfully importing 208 staff members from OP_v.48.xlsx and ANE_v.48.xlsx
- ‚úÖ Fixed `prompt()` error in "Add Custom Staff" - replaced with proper React state-based input dialog
- ‚úÖ Verified complete import functionality working in production environment

**Final Fix**: Replaced browser `prompt()` calls with React state-managed dialog for "Add Custom Staff" functionality, eliminating final Electron compatibility error.

### [2025-06-03] Application Status
**Current State**: ‚úÖ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- ‚úÖ Excel import extracting actual staff schedule data (208 staff members)
- ‚úÖ Duplicate detection and warnings working correctly  
- ‚úÖ Custom staff addition working without `prompt()` errors
- ‚úÖ All drag-and-drop functionality operational
- ‚úÖ Dashboard and admin views fully working

**Application Ready**: Swedish Operating Room Staff Scheduling application is now complete and production-ready.

### [2025-06-03] Excel Parser Rewrite  
**Prompt**: Rewrite excelParser.ts to handle direct Excel file parsing with ExcelJS for dual OP/ANE files
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Updated parser structure with new interfaces, all tests passing

### [2025-06-03] Excel Import & Staff Organization Fixes
**Prompt**: Fix duplicate detection in dual Excel import and staff not sorting into weekdays
**Outcome**: 
- ‚úÖ Fixed Excel fileHandler.ts to properly append weekday to staff names for sorting
- ‚úÖ Improved duplicate detection logic to only flag true duplicates (same person, same day, both files)
- ‚úÖ Updated staff parsing to create properly formatted names with `(weekday)` suffix
- ‚úÖ Application successfully builds and runs with Excel import functionality

### [2025-06-03] Staff Weekday Sorting Fix
**Prompt**: Fix imported staff cards appearing in "M√•ndag" tab instead of correct weekdays for planning
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Root cause identified and fixed

**Root Cause**: Excel headers contain abbreviated Swedish weekdays ("M√•n", "Tis", "Ons") but the app store filtering logic expects full Swedish day names ("M√•ndag", "Tisdag", "Onsdag"). This caused all staff to be filtered into the default "M√•ndag" tab.

**Resolution**: 
- ‚úÖ Added `convertToFullSwedishDay()` function to `fileHandler.ts` with proper abbreviation-to-full-name mapping
- ‚úÖ Modified staff name formatting in `readExcelFile()` to use full Swedish day names for proper sorting
- ‚úÖ Verified fix maintains compatibility with dual import system which already handled this correctly
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (46/46) confirming fix doesn't break existing functionality
- ‚úÖ Application builds and runs successfully with weekday sorting fix

**Key Technical Fix**: 
```typescript
// Before: name: `${nameValue} (${weekday})`  // "M√•n", "Tis" - doesn't match app store filter
// After: name: `${nameValue} (${convertToFullSwedishDay(weekday)})`  // "M√•ndag", "Tisdag" - matches filter
```

**Result**: Staff imported from Excel files are now properly distributed across all weekday tabs in the planning interface, enabling correct scheduling workflow.
