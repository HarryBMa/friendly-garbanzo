## 🧪 Prompt Guidelines
- Each time you generate code with AI or Copilot:
  - Log the date
  - Summarize the task/prompt
  - Log the result or new files created/edited
- Keep AI tasks specific and modular (1 file or behavior at a time)
- Avoid multi-purpose prompts — split UI and logic tasks separately
